# Capstone Gender Pay Gap Trends 1980-2012

This project seeks to understand and visualize pay gap trends over time using two open-source datasets (377,000 records). It found that there was an overall decrease in the pay gap percentage. The data was cleaned and prepared using SQL in DBeaver and visualizations were created in Tableau.
